# FreeCodeCamp-Courses

The purpose of this repo is to record the code I write while following the tutorials on FreeCodeCamp.org and to familiarize myself with using GitHub.

I used to create a separate repository for each course. However, this seemed wrong to me. So, I created this repository that I can use for all courses.
